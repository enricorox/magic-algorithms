# Course: Advanced Algorithms Design @ University of Padua
Some very interesting algorithms I want to test.

## Estimate PI
A (inefficient) Monte Carlo algorithm that estimate PI at arbitrary digit

## Euclid
Compute the gcd(a,b) using the famous Euclid algorithm

## Discrete root
Compute the discrete root using binary search
